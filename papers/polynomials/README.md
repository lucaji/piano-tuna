[Revised version (October 2001)](deip.pdf) (501 KiB)

Abstract:

"This paper discusses piece-wise polynomial interpolators used in audio resampling and presents new low-order designs that are optimized for high-quality resampling of oversampled audio. Source code and useful tables for using the interpolators are included."

Scarcely documented C++ source code is included.
